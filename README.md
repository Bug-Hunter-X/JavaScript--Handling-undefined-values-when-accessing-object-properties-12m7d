# JavaScript: Handling undefined values when accessing object properties

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript and its solution.

The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to access the `length` property of a potentially undefined variable. This leads to a `TypeError` when the input is undefined.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function that handles undefined values gracefully, preventing the error.
